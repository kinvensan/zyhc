            <p><strong>We do not store </strong>detailed data of payment cards in our databases. To store payment card data, we use third party payment gateways that comply with the requirements of the PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) security standards. Our databases only store the references to payment cards stored in third party payment gateways. The references we store only contain the non-sensitive data of payment cards: expiration date, first and last name of the holder and the last four digits of the card number. Payment card data is only used and stored with your explicit consent. You might delete the references to the stored payment cards at any moment. Payment card data gets also deleted from a particular third party payment gateway, provided that it makes such feature available. One has to remember that it might not be possible to delete the data completely due to the way a particular payment gateway works. Detailed information on the type of data stored by the payment gateways we use can be found in the privacy policies and terms of use of different payment gateways – <a href="#paymentdocs">learn more</a>. Deleting stored payment card data will not cancel the initiated transactions.</p>
            <p>To carry out the above we process payment card data provided through the forms available on the website. Such operation is in full compliance with the PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) requirements. All the payment data you provide is sent through an encrypted SSL (Secure Socket Layer) connection.</p>
            <p>We inform you that in order to protect your data we take all necessary actions to make sure your data does not get accidentally lost, misused, made public, or in any way modified or destroyed. We also protect it from unauthorized access.</p>
