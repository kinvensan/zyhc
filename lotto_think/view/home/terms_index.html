            <h2>3. Services</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>The Website provides services for purchasing, processing and storing Tickets for the Drawings you select and placing Deposits to be later used to purchase Tickets.</li>
            <li>The Tickets that you purchase are processed by us and sent to third-party entities in order to physically purchase them at official outlets of a particular Lottery, or processed by an alternative service (depending on a particular Lottery or the amount of its current main winnings, or according to the Company’s decision) that guarantees you benefits equal to those from the Ticket being physically purchased.</li>
            <li>Due to the nature of the service and the fact that it is instantly processed, it is not possible to waive a Ticket purchase. In view of this, all the Ticket purchase dispositions are final and not subject to cancellation or refund.</li>
            <li>The amount of Winnings is always consistent with the one officially provided by the Lottery’s Operator (after deducing potential fees) and converted to your account’s currency according to the current exchange rate, without prejudice to paragraphs 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7. Taxes, custom duties and other payments might be covered out of the Winnings both by the Operator and the Company. The above notwithstanding, you are obliged to cover all the taxes, custom duties and other payments related to collecting the Winnings.</li>
            <li>Winnings up to 2500 USD (calculated by the current exchange rate) are automatically deposited to your account. The winnings above 2500 USD are looked into individually and might be deposited to your account manually or they might require your personal appearance in order to collect the Winnings. You will be notified by us of all the procedures. You also agree to take any actions and file any documents or sign an agreement, if they are required to collect the Winnings.</li>
            <li>The winnings of the free Quick-Pick Ticket type are assigned to your Account based on the information delivered to us by the Operator, which is why they might show up on your account with delay.</li>
            <li>The company charges a 10% fee for any Winnings above 10000 USD. The company uses said fee to cover the costs of arranging the collection of the Winnings.</li>
            <li>You hereby acknowledge that your data (including personal data) might be delivered to the Operator and other third-party entities if it is required to collect the Winnings.</li>
            <li>The Company does not offer their own number games, the Lotteries are organized and managed by third-party Operators. The Company is not directly affiliated with any of the Operators. Any references to the Operators available on the Website only serve informational purposes and do not advertise the services of a particular Operator, and they do not constitute any affiliation with any of them.</li>
            <li>By using the services available on the Website you declare that all the funds that you use to purchase Tickets or make a Deposit are owned by you and do not come from theft or are not restricted or reported to proper authorities as lost.</li>
            <li>The price of a Ticket contains a fee for services made available on the Website. By using the Website you hereby surrender any right to discuss, argue or make claims in relation to the aforementioned price and acknowledge that it might differ from the official price set by the Operator.</li>
            <li>All the Ticket purchase disposals for a particular Drawing have to be placed before the date of the Drawing and the hour specified in Table 1.1. The deadline for placing Ticket purchase disposals differs in relation to a particular Lottery. We reserve the right to change the hours included in Table 1.1 in the event of the Operator postponing the Drawing date which occurs outside of our control. A Ticket purchase disposal between the hour specified in Table 1.1 and the Drawing hour might only take place for the next Drawing of a particular Lottery, of which you will be explicitly notified during the purchase process. The date of a Ticket purchase disposal is considered to be the date of receiving a receipt from the payment gateway you used to make a payment for the Ticket or the recorded date of the purchase made with your Deposit. In the event that we have delivered the receipt or the purchase disposal using your Deposit that was recorded after the Drawing date and the hour specified in Table 1.1, we reserve the right to automatically move the Ticket to the next Lottery drawing the Ticket was purchased for.<br>

            <h2>The money laundering prevention policy</h2>
            <p>Annex 2 to Lotterywd Terms of use</p>
            <p>The Company does not tolerate money laundering and supports battling this phenomenon. To do this, we follow the guidelines of Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (UK). The said group is a member of Financial Action Task Force (FATS), an international entity the purpose of which is to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. The Company runs a money laundering deterring policy. Its goals are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Making sure that the client has a valid identity document;</li>
            <li>Keeping a register of identifying information;</li>
            <li>Establishing if clients are not known terrorists or are not suspected of terrorist connections by checking personal data on adequate lists;</li>
            <li>Close monitoring of clients’ transactions;</li>
            <li>Not accepting cash payments, postal orders, transactions carried out through third-party entities, currency exchanges or Western Union transfers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>International prevention of money laundering requires financial institutions to be aware of potential attempts of such actions and abuse that may occur on clients’ accounts and introduce compatibility programs the purpose of which is deterring, exposing and reporting suspicious activity.</p>
            <p>The above guidelines have been implemented in order to protect the Website and its clients.</p>
